						CODE COVERAGE

WHAT  & WHY ?
	-> When a Development Project is put together, Testers need to verify the Development for bugs,
		errors, performance ..etc before it can be made PRODUCTION READY.

	-> For Testing the project TESTERS create a series of TEST CASES for the Development to pass 
		through successfully before it can be put into PRODUCTION.

	-> Code Coverage is the property of TEST CASES to verify percentage of lines of a program executed
		using those test cases.

	-> The more lines Tests cover, Better the Test Cases, Higher the Code Coverage.

	-> No matter what the Development Software/Program/Kit, every one has their own tools for Testing
		the Product, before they can deploy into Production.
